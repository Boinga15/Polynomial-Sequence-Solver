# Polynomial-Sequence-Solver
A C++ program that can take a polynomial sequence and find the nth term.

Note: A polynomial sequence is a sequence which has an nth term in a similar form to an^x + bn^y + cn^z...

The program will take a sequence and return the different constants for each term that form the nth term. Also comes with a main.cpp file which allows you to test the program.
